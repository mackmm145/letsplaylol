I am a fan of League of Legend and wanted to meet other players because I only have a few friends IRL that play LoL. After Average_Noxian started the /r/letsplaylol subreddit in an attempt to connect casual players with each other, I thought that a website like this would be a good resource. I left like forum and reddit posts didn't quite do it right and other matching websites were geared more towards ranked players instead of casual players (there are a lot more of us).

Visit the LetsPlayLoL subreddit

In game chat: Private chatroom "/r/letsplaylol"

Unofficial Teamspeak server: ts.killstealgaming.com [no password] (Thank you, sokii!)

As opposed to everyone creating user accounts, I've taken the "craigslist" approach where email addresses are used to edit / delete postings.

Currently, your listing will appear as soon as you submit; however, if this gets abused, I will add captchas and make email confirmation links mandatory.

Thanks!
